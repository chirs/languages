### What is Kannada?

Kannada is one of the most widely spoken langages in the world, spoken by upwards of 50 million people.

### What is this?

Despite Kannada's popularity, there are no good resources published in Kannada.

This was conceived as an open-source Kannada language book and website. The goal was to produce - for free - the best resource for learning Kannada language.

But that goal doesn't seem like it's going to get done - at least not before somebody else makes something better. So instead, this is just the part of my personal languages repository devoted to my Kannada language studies.
